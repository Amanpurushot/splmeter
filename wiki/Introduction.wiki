Sound Pressure Level Meter : SPL Meter is a device used to measure the environment sound pressure levels. It's a must for engineers who work with audio processing.

= Introduction =

 SPL Meter for Android OS is a software version of the Sound Pressure Level Meter. It uses the inbuilt microphone of the mobile phone to capture audio and calculates the sound pressure level from it.

 SPL Meter is a very expensive equipment. This software version of the SPL Meter can be used by amateurs to simulate the actual SPL Meter.

I = Z * w * w * A * A

Z -> acoustic impedance = about 406.2 for air at 30 degree celcius
w = 2*pi*f where f is the frequency
A = amplitude

sound pressure, p = square root ( I * Z )

SPL = 20 * log10 *( p / p0 )

where p0 = 0.00002
